This is an early stub of an iOS app for uploading photos to Wikimedia Commons --
actually it uploads them to test2.wikipedia.org. You can see uploaded files at
<http://test2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:NewFiles>

User credentials should be input on the settings flipside of the app before uploading.
They are saved to the app's keychain, so need not be entered again.

Code implementing the MediaWiki web API is in the mwapi/ subdirectory -- these will be
rewritten shortly to use JSON objects instead of XML.


Todo:
* Detect login and upload errors and give feedback to the user.
* After uploading, display a button that opens the new file in Safari
* Move i/o off the UI thread and provide visual progress feedback.
* When pulling existing images from the gallery, retrieve the original file via asset URL
  and upload that instead of recompression from a UIImage
* Rearrange UI into multiple steps: login, get photo, give description, upload.
* queue up multiple items
* cancel ability
* clean up classes
